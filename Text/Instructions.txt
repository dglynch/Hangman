This is the traditional game of hangman.
Your objective, as the potential
'hangee,' is to guess which letters are
contained in a mystery word, whose
category is determined by you and whose
length and irregular punctuation are
known. If you guess a letter which is in
the word, all occurences of that letter
will be revealed, and the game will
continue. Should the letter not be
present, one of your body parts will
appear on the gallows. Once your entire
body (six parts) appears, you are hanged
and the game is over. Should you
successfully guess all letters in the
word before being hanged, you have won!
